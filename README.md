## About

BrainQuest is a fun trivia game. The core gameplay loop is straightforward, pick a difficulty and do your best to answer all the questions correctly in as little as possible. Receive a score and see how you compare to other players on the leaderboard. <br><br>
As simple as it might sound, I can guarantee you a lot of work was put into it.
